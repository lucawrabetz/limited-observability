## Pessimistic models for bilevel optimization with limited observability.

Three MIP models (single level reformulations) for three different bilevel problems with limited observability:
- One where the follower controls the uncertainty set and the bilevel problem is optimistic 
- One where the follower controls the uncertainty set and the bilevel problem is pessimistic
- One where the leader controls the uncertainty set and the bilevel problem is pessimistic
